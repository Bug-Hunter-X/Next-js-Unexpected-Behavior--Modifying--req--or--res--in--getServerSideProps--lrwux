In Next.js, a rather uncommon error arises when using server-side props or getStaticProps with a function that inadvertently modifies the `req` or `res` objects within the API routes.  For instance, if you directly mutate the `req.body` object within your getServerSideProps function, it might lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or even crashes.  This is due to Next.js's internal handling of these objects.  The problem is often subtle because it might not throw an immediate error but rather produce erratic results.

```javascript
// pages/my-page.js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { req, res } = context;
  // Incorrect: Modifying req.body directly
  req.body.someProperty = 'newValue'; //This is a problem!

  // ... rest of your code ...

  return {
    props: {
      // ... your props
    },
  };
}
```
